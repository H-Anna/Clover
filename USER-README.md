# Clover v0.1.0
This is a WIP project that may contain bugs or crash. It contains a *data* folder with a sample mascot, and a *Clover* executable to use it, as well as libraries Clover requires to run.
## Running Clover
Clover is currently available on Windows (both 32 and 64-bit) and Unix systems (Debian, RPM, tarGZ). I wish to make it available to OSX users eventually. If you wish to use it on platforms with which the release is incompatible, you will have to build the project manually.
Make sure the *data* folder is either next to, or at most 3 levels above the *Clover* executable in your file system. Do not move the *data* folder or the *Clover* executable individually, or rename the *data* folder, as that may prevent Clover from working properly.
## Interacting with the mascot
Press the T button to make the lion talk. You can double-click him to bring up a "menu" - it currently contains nothing, and only serves to demonstrate how a menu would be set up in Clover. Bringing your cursor over the lion's head will turn it into a hand - this means you can pet the lion using the mouse wheel. You can hold the left mouse button and drag the mascot to put it elsewhere on your screen, and the same can be done with the speech balloon. Finally, you can exit Clover via the right-click menu or by pressing Ctrl+Q.
## Making your own mascot
Making a mascot requires knowledge with JSON file structure, HTML formatting, and Clover's documentation, the latter of which is included with the *data* folder.
