# Clover - Baseware for Desktop Mascots
Software dedicated to display a desktop mascot that talks to the user and provides various other functions.
## Features:
### Out-of-the-box
Although this software is still Work In Progress, supported features may include:

 - Talking to the user
 - Talking to each other, when multiple mascots are running
 - Opening browser links, emails and files with your default choice of software

### Open-source
Clone this project and modify it to your liking. Licenced under GPLv3, all software derived from Clover is required to be open-source as well. However, you may keep the rights to non-code works, such as artwork and dialogue, therefore mascots that do not have extra functions are not considered derivations. (Artwork currently featured on the repo was made for testing purposes, and is not covered by GPLv3. It may be removed from future releases.)
### Cross-platform
The goal is for Clover to be available to Windows, Linux and OSX users alike.
### Technology
Clover is written in C++, built with CMake, and uses the Qt framework for its Widgets, among other things.
### Documentation
Extensive documentation will be created for multiple skill levels or goals. Perhaps you have very little knowledge of programming and just want to create a mascot. Maybe you want to contribute to Clover itself. Whatever your objective, you should be provided with quality documentation, online or offline, that you can refer to at any time.
